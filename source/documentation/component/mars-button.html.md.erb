# mars-button

Component to make all kinds of buttons, you can make as many beautiful and decorative buttons as you want.

<%#= source %>

## Examples

<%# example_tabs do %>
<%#= file_example_scss %>
<%#= file_example_dist %>
<%# end %>

If you only need a simple button you can call the mixin directly as the following example.

<div class="alert">
If you need to generate several buttons it is preferable to use @extend from the common block of content, in this way we will generate only the css that is different in both buttons.
</div>

<% example_html do %>
<button class="orange-button">button</button>
<% end %>


### Multiple buttons

To generate multiple buttons you can use the generic @mixin <%= link_to 'mars-build-components','documentation/builders/mars-build-components' %>, visit the page on the builder to better understand how it works and arguments.


<% example_html do %>
<button class="btn-primary">btn-primary</button>
<button class="btn-default">btn-default</button>
<% end %>


The `$mars-buttons` contains the variations written on a map and its name is generated by adding the prefix that we pass to the mixin.


### Multiple variations

If we would like, for example, to have other buttons with another size using the same elements, we could create a new `@extend`, in this example we will add all at once to be able to see the resulting css


<% example_html do %>
<button class="btn-primary">btn-sm-primary</button>
<button class="btn-default">btn-sm-default</button>
<button class="btn-sm-primary">btn-sm-primary</button>
<button class="btn-sm-default">btn-sm-default</button>
<% end %>
