## elements

since
: 1.0.0

arguments
: `$prefix`: `$prefix-elements` *[string]*: this is added to the beginning of selectors.

Add all the marscss elements with $prefix by default '.'

add rules for the main tags of the page, `elements()` if included if we did not specify otherwise from `@include marscss`, but if we wish we can include it directly, you can see an example of a complex configuration in recipes.

~~~scss
@include style(elements());
~~~

## customize elements

You have a group of variables that you can use to modify some of the properties.

<%= code_snippet('fonts',
                 "#{config.marscss_path}/core/_default-variables.scss") %>

As when working with any other part of the core it is enough to modify the functions before making the elements call or use any of the functions, there are 2 global functions that help us rewrite several elements at the same time `common-heading` `common-text-block` `common-list-block`.

In the first example we are going to directly rewrite `common-heading`

### rewrite common-heading()

~~~scss
@function common-heading() {
  @return style(
    margin-bottom(3rem),
    margin-top(1rem)
  );
}
~~~

If we wanted to modify a function reusing its previous value we could do it in this way, in this example we are going to add the red color to the rules that have `element-h1`

### rewrite element-h1()

~~~scss
$my-h1: style(
  element-h1(),
  this(color($red))
);

@function element-h1() {
  @return $my-h1;
}
~~~

In this way, we call <%= link_to 'include extend', '/documentation/include-extend' %> later to this modification of the core the color of the `%h1` will be generated with our rule modification, that is why it is very important that the modifications of the core are grouped before the <%= link_to 'include marscss', '/documentation/include-marscss' %> or <%= link_to 'include extend', '/documentation/include-extend' %>, as you can see in <%= link_to 'recipes', '/documentation/recipes#recipes' %>.
