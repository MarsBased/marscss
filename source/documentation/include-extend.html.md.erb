# @include extend

Add the main selectors starting with "%" to be used from @extend from your code or other parts of the application, *extend* is automatically added from the <%= link_to '@include marscss', '/documentation/include-marscss' %>.

The main advantage of working with these extends is that they do not send any content to our css until they are called and on the other hand they help us to reuse the selectors in a more compact way.

## Resets

`%reset-link, %reset-heading, %reset-text-block, %reset-list, %reset-checks`

## Grid

`%grid-column, %container, %row`

## Elements

`%a, %h1, %h2, %h3, %h4, %h5, %h6, %blockquote, %p, %ul, %ol, %li, %dl, %dt, %dd`

Add the following selectors of the html tags inside an invisible element `%raw-html-styles`

`a, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, blockquote, p, ul, ol, li, dl, dt, dd`

It is very useful to extend classes or elements that will contain html tagging as markdown to give them the styles

## forms

`%focus, %%form-element, %form-checks, %label, %input, %textarea, %select, %radio, %checkbox`
