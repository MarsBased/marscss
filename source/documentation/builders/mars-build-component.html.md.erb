# mars-build-component

This builder allows you to generate complex components with design variations

To understand the operation of this builder it is preferable that you look deeply at the operation of the [map scss](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#maps) and the functioning of the [placeholders selectors](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#placeholder_selectors_foo).

: `$elements: ('')` *[map]*: Is responsible for generating the different variations and allows you to add the specific.properties
: `$default: ()` *[map]*: It allows to pass a map to merge to add some default properties that will be overwritten by the `$elements`.
