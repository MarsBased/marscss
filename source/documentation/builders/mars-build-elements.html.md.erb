# mars-build-elements

The idea of marscss is to avoid that we have to redefine the presentation of the markup depending on the semantic.

elements gives you a generic class to give the main appearances, The name of these classes coincide with the marking of HTML to simplify its use, allows you to enter a prefix to customize the name of those class.

Also use the extends to use it with the default markup on some elements such as a markdown container
