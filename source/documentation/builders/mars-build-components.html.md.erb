#mars-build-components

When generating the component, the system works from 2 [map scss](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#maps), one acts generating properties of the $default and $elements generates the different variations, both map merge processing the result, you can pass as a `false` value if we want the element not to launch the default value

[TODO]
