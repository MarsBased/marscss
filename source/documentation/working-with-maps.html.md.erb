# Working with maps

Marscss stores and works the selectors through scss maps, this allows you to manipulate them and save them until they have to be printed in our css file.

## CSS to MAP

The structure of the maps is as follows, in scss the maps are enclosed with (), the maps can be composed of other maps, they work like arrays in the programming languages.

<% example_tabs do %>
<%= css_snippet('e-1',@exampleFile) %>
<%= css_snippet('e-1',@exampleDistFile) %>
<% end %>

A particularity of the maps is that we can merge with others and get a new map, in this case we will also create a map with an internal selector, which will be responsible for generating the hover styles of the title

<% example_tabs do %>
<%= css_snippet('e-2',@exampleFile) %>
<%= css_snippet('e-2',@exampleDistFile) %>
<% end %>

When we add values to false these are canceled, it is also very important the order of the elements when making a merge, the last element predominates.

<% example_tabs do %>
<%= css_snippet('e-3',@exampleFile) %>
<%= css_snippet('e-3',@exampleDistFile) %>
<% end %>

We can be generated using directly &, this allows us to integrate it better with the normal css rules, we can also add more arguments to modify it directly from `@include style`

<% example_tabs do %>
<%= css_snippet('e-4',@exampleFile) %>
<%= css_snippet('e-4',@exampleDistFile) %>
<% end %>

marscss has tools to simplify the writing of these maps, with functions to generate the rules more quickly or to add and work directly on the css properties

<% example_tabs do %>
<%= css_snippet('e-5',@exampleFile) %>
<%= css_snippet('e-5',@exampleDistFile) %>
<% end %>
