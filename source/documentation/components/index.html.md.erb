# Components of Mars

On Mars we use a different system of components that you can find on earth, unlike these we do not use rules, we use [mixins](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#mixins).

~~~scss
.search-input {
  @include mars-search;
}
~~~

These [mixins](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#mixins) can receive some argument to be overwritten but if you need to make many modifications on it my recommendation is that you add it to your own core and adapt it as you like.

~~~scss
.search-input {
  @include mars-search($bg: $black, $color: $white );
  color: $white;
}
~~~

This allows us to generate components that are not compiled if they are not called from a selector or a builder, in this way you can adapt your writing system to the component selector.

Some more complex components in which we need aspect variations like
 <%= link_to 'alerts','components/alerts' %>,
 <%= link_to 'buttons','components/buttons' %>,
 <%= link_to 'labels', 'components/labels' %>.... we use
 <%= link_to 'mars-build-component', 'builders/components' %>
 , which allows us to join [sass maps](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#maps) with the element that we extend.
