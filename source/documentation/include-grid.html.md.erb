# @include grid

marscss uses as [bootstrap 4.0 grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) you can look in your documentation how to use the different classes that these helpers will generate.

arguments
: `$prefix-container: 'container'` *[string]*:
: `$prefix-row: 'row'` *[string]*:
: `$container-max-widths: $containers-max-widths` *[map]*:


## @include grid-container

Generating the class for the container uses $containers-max-widths to generate the media queries for each $breakpoints.

It also generates a maximum width using the array $container-max-widths, which can be called by using the class `.container-{breakpoint}`

## @include grid-row

It is responsible for working as a container for the generation of the columns, it has a negative margin to justify the margin of the internal columns.

## @include grid-columns

Is responsible for generating the markup to work directly with the bootstrap class, it also adds order and offset.

This is about the heaviest part of the framework as you can see in the css tab, unless we need a class marking for the creation of columns I advise working through the bootstrap mixins for the generation of columns, make-col, make-col-ready and make-col-offset.
