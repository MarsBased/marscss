#Getting started

Get started with marscss, the only advanced CSS framework weighting 0KB.
What’s marscss (and how can it weight 0KB?)

marscss is a CSS framework built on top of SASS (one of the most popular CSS preprocessors). It uses mixins to define the styles of each element instead of regular CSS, thus making it possible to include in your final CSS file only the rules you are really going to use.

It weights 0KB because it doesn’t add anything to your CSS by default. Because everything is encapsulated within mixins, the styles are not copied to your CSS file unless you explicitly include each rule or set of rules.

##How to use?

Install the dependency

~~~shell
npm i @marsbased/marscss --save
~~~~

Use it from your main scss file:

~~~scss
@import 'node_modules/marscss/marscss';
~~~

Alternatively, if you are using a bundler you probably can use a shortcut like:

~~~scss
@import '~marscss/marscss';
~~~

##Copyright, license and contributions

marscss was invented by Javier Artero and it's backed up by MarsBased, a leading Ruby and Rails & Angular development company. It is still in its early stages and it's published under the MIT license, so anyone is free to fork the repository and use it as one pleases. Any altruistic contribution or feedback will be very well received.

## Basic Usage

Once introduced, this will not add a line to your processed CSS file, but you will have access to all the mixins and functions of the core.

If you want to access the extends and the default reset of the html marckup you need to call marscss after the @import

~~~scss
@import 'node_modules/marscss/marscss';

@include marscss;
~~~

The way marscss works allows us to rewrite any part of its core since until we do the @include marscss we do not release any of its functions and mixins

## Resets

After many years working in CSS, we have realized that when we work with html elements from the css we restart most of their properties, this makes us waste time and generates a lot of unusable code.

The philosophy of marscss is to separate the markup of the style with what is eliminated any type of presentation of the marckup html, by calling marscss allways and when it is not set to false this small reset will be added.

<% example_tabs do %>
<%= file_example_scss('example-reset.scss') %>
<%= file_example_dist('exampleReset.css') %>
<% end %>


## Extend

marscss includes a set of selectors to work directly from @extend, these are included from `@include marscss` but if you prefer you can use `@include extend`

Some functions such as helpers or other builders use the extends to optimize the resulting code
